# Tabtosearch

This is a simple addon for Firefox which tries to imitate the "tab to search" feature in Chrome.

It's really easy to use: just start typing the name of a website, press tab and then type the query to use their local search (not Google _site:_ search).

The search urls are registered automatically the first time you search on the site. No need to configure anything.
